	A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games can be used for practice/self-testing skills, cooperative play or competitive play. There are four basic types of games: invasion/territory, net/wall, striking/fielding and target.</p>
